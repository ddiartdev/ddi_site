    		<hr>
     		<h3 class="privacy">The DoubleDown Casino is a social gaming website ("Website") intended for players 21 years and older. DoubleDown Casino does not offer "real money gambling" or an opportunity to win real money or prizes based on the outcome of play. Playing DoubleDown Casino does not imply future success at "real money gambling."</h3>

		<p >The DoubleDown Casino is a social gaming website ("Website") intended for players 21 years and older. DoubleDown Casino does not offer "real money gambling" or an opportunity to win real money or prizes based on the outcome of play.  Playing DoubleDown Casino does not imply future success at "real money gambling."</p>

		<p >The games and other activities offered on the Website are referred to in this Privacy Notice as the "Services".</p>

		<p >Please read this Privacy Notice carefully before accessing this Website or using our Services as it provides important information about how we collect, store, use and disclose your information when providing our Services to you or when you access this Website.  You should also review the Terms of Use for important information about your use of the Website and our Services.</p>

		<p >DoubleDown Casino is managed and operated by DoubleDown Interactive B.V.  and its affiliated companies, including DoubleDown Interactive, LLC (collectively referred to as "DoubleDown" or "our" or "we" or "us").  Visitors to the DoubleDown Casino Website and users of the Services are referred to as "you."</p>

		<h3>Types of Information We Collect</h3>
		<p ><strong>Passive Information</strong><br>
		Passive information refers to information that is automatically collected from your device(s). DoubleDown may collect passive information from you during your use of the Services, including your IP address, referral data, browser type, browser language, platform type, type of mobile or other computing device, and geographical data, such as zip code and geographic location.  Your browser or device typically sends passive information to our servers without your intervention whenever you visit our Website.  For example, your browser or device may tell us your IP address (which may tell us generally where you are located) and the type of browser and device you are using. When you visit our Website, your browser may also tell us information such as the page that led you to our Website and, if applicable, the search terms you typed into a search engine that led you to our Website.</p>


		<p ><strong>Use of Non-Personal Information</strong><br>
		DoubleDown collects this non-personal information for purposes of tracking and analyzing user preferences and trends in order to improve the quality and design of the Services and to create new features, promotions, and functionalities; for editorial and feedback purposes; for marketing and promotional purposes; for content improvement; and to customize the Services. This information may also be shared with advertisers and our business partners on an aggregated non-personal basis.</p>

		<p ><strong>Personal Information</strong><br>
		Personal information, which is sometimes referred to as personally identifiable information, means information that is specific to you and can be used to contact or identify you.  Unless you are using the Services on a guest basis, you must have a valid, active Facebook account to use and access the Services.  Accordingly, we receive from Facebook certain personal data about you that you authorize Facebook to disclose, such as your user name, date of birth, friend list, email address and profile picture, or you may voluntarily disclose information such as your gender or your play preferences to us through your use of the Services. Any information directly collected through your Facebook account and shared with us will be imported, used and stored in a manner consistent with the Facebook Platform Policy applicable to developers in effect at the time of collection (see <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/policy/" target="_blank&quot;_blank&quot;">https://developers.facebook.com/policy/</a>) and in compliance with any specific privacy settings set by you of which we are aware. We may also collect information from companies that help us to operate the Website and provide services such as processing credit card payments and sending emails on our behalf.  As a result, we may receive confirmation that you have made a payment by credit card and other information related to any of your gaming transactions. To help keep our databases current and to provide you the most relevant content and experiences, we may combine personal information from you with information from public sources and our trusted partners, in accordance with applicable law and this Privacy Notice.</p>
		<p >Please note that because a third party site manages your purchases of virtual currency for use with the Services, DoubleDown does not have access to your credit card or billing information.</p>

		<p ><strong>DoubleDown Emails</strong><br> 
		Emails we send you may include a web beacon that tells us whether and at what time you have received or opened the email, or clicked a link within the email. If you do not want us to collect this information from our marketing emails, you can opt out of receiving DoubleDown marketing emails.</p>

		<p ><strong>DoubleDown Online Advertising</strong><br> 
		DoubleDown utilizes online advertising, including displaying DoubleDown advertisements to you across the Internet on websites and in applications. We collect information about which advertisements are displayed, which advertisements are clicked on, and on which web page the advertisement was displayed.</p>

		<p ><strong>Third Party Advertising</strong><br> DoubleDown permits third parties to place advertisements on our properties.  When advertisers or advertising networks place advertisements on DoubleDown properties, they may collect or we may share the following types of information from within our properties:</p>

		<ol class="infotextNumBullet">
			<li>performance data (like the number of clicks on an advertisement);</li>

			<li>aggregated and/or de-identified information about you and other players collectively that is not intended to specifically identify you (like players between the ages of 30 and 40 who also own a Lamborghini);</li>

			<li>certain technical information (for example, IP addresses, non-permanent and anonymous device identifiers such as Apple Identifier For Advertisers (IDFAs), and Google Advertising ID);</li>

			<li>your social network ID;</li>

			<li>other contextual data about your game play (for example, games played and session length).</li>
		</ol>

		<p>After clicking on a third party advertisement you may no longer be on a site hosted by DoubleDown or the social network through which you are playing our games.  Information that you disclose in connection with a third party advertisement is not governed by DoubleDown's Privacy Notice.</p>

		<p ><strong>California Do Not Track Disclosures</strong><br>
		The California Online Privacy Protection Act also known as CalOPPA requires that online privacy notices disclose how a site responds to "Do Not Track" signals ("DNT").  There is no consensus yet on how the companies you encounter should interpret DNT signals.  As a result, most sites, including DoubleDown, do not respond when they receive a DNT signal.  This Privacy Notice explains other ways in which you can protect your privacy.</p>

		<h3>How Your Information Is Used</h3>

		<p ><strong>Use of Personal Information</strong><br>DoubleDown will use personal information in the following ways:</p>
			
			<ol class="infotextNumBullet">
				<li>to fulfill your requests for our Services;</li>
				<li>to process and respond to your inquiries;</li>
				<li>to improve the Services, including diagnosis or problems with the Services;</li>
				<li>to help us better understand demographic characteristics of our users;</li>
				<li>to present advertising that is tailored to your interests;</li>
				<li>to offer you other opportunities that we think may be of interest to you.</li>
			</ol>

		<p >
		In addition, DoubleDown may use personal information to communicate with you through email regarding new products, new features, product updates and enhancements or special offers or promotions for the Services. These email communications may also include offers from DoubleDown marketing partners, although such partners will not be provided with your personal information.</p>

		<p ><strong>Use of Passive Information</strong><br>DoubleDown collects passive information for purposes of tracking and analyzing user preferences and trends in order to improve the quality and design of the Services and to create new features, promotions, and functionalities; for editorial and feedback purposes; for marketing and promotional purposes; for content improvement; and to customize the Services. This information may also be shared with advertisers and our business partners on an aggregated anonymous basis.</p>

		<p ><strong>Use of Information Collected by Third Party Advertising</strong><br>
			The information collected may be used to:</p>
			
			<ol class="infotextNumBullet">
				<li>measure how effective advertisements are, to offer you targeted advertising in order to personalize your experience by showing you advertisements for products and services that are more likely to appeal to you (a practice known as behavioral advertising);</li>
				<li>undertake web analytics to analyze traffic and other player activity to improve your experience; and/or</li>
				<li>engage in activities such as frequency capping, attribution, conversion events, estimating the number of unique users, advertising fraud detection, and debugging.</li>
			</ol>

		<p>Advertisers or advertising networks may collect the foregoing information through the use of tracking technologies like tracking pixels, browser cookies, and web beacons, and they may use a single tracking technology or multiple tracking technologies at the same time.<br>
		</p>

		<h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
		<p >DoubleDown works with companies that help us provide the Services and operate the Website. These companies provide services such as processing credit card payments, and sending emails on our behalf. In some cases, these companies have access to those portions of your personal information that are necessary in order to provide services to you on our behalf. They are not permitted to use your information for their own purposes.</p>

		<p >DoubleDown will not disclose your personal information to third parties except in the following circumstances: (1) We may disclose personal information in response to legal process; for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena; (2) We may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, or as otherwise required by law; (3) We may transfer information about you if we are acquired by or merged with another company or in the unlikely event that DoubleDown is dissolved; (4) If we need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested; (5) If we need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of DoubleDown to provide a product or service to you in conjunction with your use of the DoubleDown  Casino (Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personal information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us); (6) We may provide personal information to third parties for analytics purposes. Such personal information may not be used by the third party for any purpose other than analysis; or (7) We may provide personal information to our corporate affiliates, such as IGT.</p>

		<h3>How You Can Manage Your Information</h3>

		<p ><strong>Access Through Third-Party Sites</strong><br>
		The privacy controls for your personal data that is transmitted to us from Facebook are managed through your Facebook account. You should carefully consider and establish your own privacy preferences for the Services through your Facebook account. We are not responsible for the personal data, your profile, your location information or other information that you choose to disclose on the Services through synchronization with your Facebook account. Any personal data or other information obtained from your Facebook account will be shared publicly in the Services in accordance with the privacy settings you have applied to such data through your Facebook account.</p>

		<p >If you access the Services through a third-party website ("Partner Site"), you should review the Privacy Notice and Terms of Use for the Partner Site.  We do not have responsibility for any information you provide on the Partner Site except the information received from our Partner Sites in a manner consistent with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by the terms of your agreement and privacy setting with the Partner Site.</p>

		<p >If you are interested in more information about tailored advertising and your choices to prevent third parties from delivering tailored web and mobile web advertising, you may visit the following websites:</p>

		<ol class="infotextNumBullet">

			<li><a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt-Out Page</a> or the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">Digital Advertising Alliance Opt-Out Page for U.S.-based advertising;</a> and</li>

			<li><a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices" target="_blank">Your Online Choices UK website for EU-based advertising</a>.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>These opt-out tools are provided by third parties, not DoubleDown and may not be available with respect to all advertising that is presented to you.  DoubleDown does not control or operate these tools or the choices that advertisers and others provide through these tools.</p>

		<p >In addition, if you do not want to receive tailored in-application advertisements from third parties that relate to your interests in apps on your mobile device, you may opt-out by adjusting the ad tracking settings on your device. You can also reset the "Advertising Identifier" (like an IDFA) from your mobile device’s settings page, which will prevent continued use of existing behavioral data tied to the previous "Advertising Identifier."</p>

		<p ><strong>Opt Out Page</strong><br>
		If you wish to change how the personal information that you provide to Facebook is used by us, including the use of such information to send promotional messages to you, you may change your settings on your Facebook account or contact us at <a href="mailto:support@doubledowninteractive.com">support@doubledowncasino.com</a>.  In the event you want to opt-out of DoubleDown emails, you may do so at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe links located within each DoubleDown email. Please note that opting out may affect your ability to receive information from DoubleDown or to have access to all of the Services.</p>

		<p >You may also request that your DoubleDown account be disabled by emailing <a href="mailto:support@doubledowninteractive.com">support@doubledowncasino.com</a>.</p>

		<p >You may "opt out" of the use of your personal information for third party analytics purposes by emailing (using the same email address as when you registered) your request to <a href="mailto:support@doubledowninteractive.com">support@doubledowncasino.com</a></p>


		<p ><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
		While you are using the Services, our web servers may seek to place a "cookie" (a small data file) on your mobile device, computer or other participating device.  If you access our Website via a Partner Site, the Partner Site may also place cookies on your device as permitted by the terms of the agreement and your privacy settings with the Partner Site.  Cookies placed by us are not used to obtain  any personal data, and the information that is tracked is used only for internal purposes, such as to improve the Services. If you prefer not to accept cookies, you can set your web browser on your computer or device to reject them or to alert you before one is placed. Some of our features and services may not function properly if you disable cookies.</p>

		<p ><strong>Offer Walls</strong><br>
		DoubleDown games or their purchase pages may display an "offer wall" that is hosted by an offer wall provider. The offer wall allows third party advertisers to provide virtual currency or other rewards to players in exchange for interacting with an advertisement or for completing a marketing offer that may include signing up for an account with one of those advertisers. These offers are not made by DoubleDown. These offers may be shown to you based on certain technical information, like your geographic area or de-identified demographic information. After clicking on one of these offers, you will no longer be on a site hosted by DoubleDown or the social network through which you are playing DoubleDown's games. To properly credit player accounts and to prevent fraud, a unique identifier, in some cases your social network ID or DoubleDown player ID, will be shared with the offer wall provider.</p>

		<p >Except as described above, we will not trade, lease, exchange or sell your personal information with or to any other third party.</p>

		<p ><strong>Security</strong><br>
		We will only collect and use personal information in accordance with this Privacy Notice to the extent deemed reasonably necessary to serve our legitimate business purposes, and we will maintain appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security safeguards to ensure the security, integrity, accuracy and privacy of the information you have provided. Please be aware, however, that no information system is totally secure, and therefore we cannot guarantee against all potential security breaches.  Thus, while we will use reasonable security and monitoring controls in accordance with general industry standards to secure information you provide to us consistent with our legal requirements, we cannot guarantee that such information will not be unlawfully or illegitimately obtained by unauthorized parties.</p>

		<p >Please be aware that if you are accessing or attempting to use this Website or otherwise communicating with us, your personal information may be transferred, stored or processed across national borders because our servers and the companies we have selected to help us run our business are located in different countries around the world, where the data protection laws might not be as comprehensive as those in your country.</p>

		<p ><strong>Third Party Web Sites</strong><br>
		The Services may contain links to other websites, including those of advertisers. DoubleDown is not responsible for the security measures, privacy practices, or content of third-party web sites. Once you leave the Website, using any of these links, although no warning will be displayed, the privacy practices mentioned in this Privacy Notice do not apply and we invite you to examine the privacy notices that govern the other sites.</p>

		<p ><strong>Access to and Ability to Correct Personal Data</strong><br>
		If you have questions or requests about this Privacy Notice, you may contact us by e-mail at <a href="mailto:support@doubledowninteractive.com">support@doubledowncasino.com</a>.  Upon request via our online <a href="https://doubledowncasino1.zendesk.com/hc/en-us" target="_blank">Help Center</a>, or e-mail, DoubleDown will provide you a summary of any personal information retained by us regarding you. Users may modify, correct, change, or update their personal record through their Facebook account or cause their personal record to be removed from DoubleDown's database. DoubleDown will only send personal records to the e-mail address on file for the user name associated with it.</p>

		<p ><strong>Age Restrictions</strong><br>
		Our Services do not knowingly solicit information from, or market to, any person under the age of twenty-one (21). In particular, consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, we will not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of thirteen (13).  If you become aware that a member of your family or any person under your responsibility has provided us with information without your consent, please contact us using the contact information as indicated in this Privacy Notice in order to delete that information as quickly as possible.</p>

		<p ><strong>DoubleDown's Right to Contact User</strong><br>
		DoubleDown reserves the right to contact users regarding this Privacy Notice, or any other policies or agreements relevant to users.</p>

		<p ><strong>Changes to the Privacy Notice</strong><br>
		We may revise this Privacy Notice at any time, as we deem appropriate, consistent with the principles described in this notice, our evolving business needs, or changes in applicable laws or regulations. If we make any changes to this Privacy Notice, we will update the "Last updated" date below.  You are advised to consult this Privacy Notice regularly for any changes, and your continued use of this Website after such changes have been made constitutes informed consent of those changes.</p>
